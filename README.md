## Introduction
Recommendation systems enable users to access products that they may not be aware of. The two traditional recommendation techniques are content-based and collaborative filtering. While both methods have their own advantages, they also have certain disadvantages, some of which can be solved by combining both techniques to improve the quality of the recommendation. Broadly speaking, a recommendation system provides specific suggestions about items (products or actions) within a given domain, which may  interest the given active user.

Here we have designed a product recommendation system which can provide appropriate suggestions to the customers while buying another products. We are designing the system such that it suggests the item based on the ratings of all the other items and also according to their purchase history.It helps the users to make a right choice and also it makes the content more personalised.
