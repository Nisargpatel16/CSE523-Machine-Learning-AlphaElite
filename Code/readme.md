## Clustering_RecommendationBasedOn_ProuductId_Ratings.ipynb
- In this file we have made clustering with text data(description of product) using inbulit K means function.

## Cosine_and_Jacard_Similarity.ipynb
- In this file we have implemented Jaccard similarity and cosine similarity using libraries.


## K_means_inbuilt_with_user_defined.ipynb
- in this file we have implemented K means algorith with inbuilt function and we also made K means function using scratch.


## TextBasedCLustering_On_ProductDescription.ipynb
- In this file we have imlemnted clustering using userId and Product rating.
